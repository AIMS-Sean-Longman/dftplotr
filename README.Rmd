# dftplotR

dftplotR is an R package to provide standardised charts formatting in ggplot2. It includes theme functions which meet Government Statistical Service (GSS) best practice guidance. It also includes colour palettes based on DfT corporate branding which meet WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards, and are distinguishable in greyscale.

## Installation

You can install dftplotR with:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("departmentfortransport/dftplotr")
```

## Overview

The package contains the following functions:

```scale_colour_dft```: ggplot function which applies one of a range of DfT palettes to a ggplot line chart (or other chart which groups by **colour**)

```scale_fill_dft```: ggplot function which applies one of a range of DfT palettes to a ggplot line chart (or other chart which groups by **fill**)

```display_palette```: a visual output which shows all of the colours contained in the selected DfT palette

```palette_picker_tool```: loads an interactive Shiny dashboard which allows users to build their own custom palettes of up to 5 colours using the DfT corporate colours.
